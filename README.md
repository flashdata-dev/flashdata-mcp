# FlashData MCP

Use Google Search, YouTube data, and downloads to your cloud storage from an MCP client. This MIT-licensed package implements the tools and calls the FlashData REST APIs directly. It does not proxy a hosted MCP connection.

This is a release candidate. Source code is available at [flashdata-dev/flashdata-mcp](https://github.com/flashdata-dev/flashdata-mcp). The package name `@flashdata/mcp` is provisional until publisher ownership is confirmed; this project has not been published to npm. Install from source using the steps below.

This directory is a complete, standalone project. Use its contents as the root of your GitHub repository, including `.github/` and `.gitignore`. Installation and tests require no files from another checkout.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.18 or newer and a FlashData API key from [your console](https://flashdata.dev/app/api-keys). The Management API must support `/v2/api-access` and its balance, pricing and limits routes. Deploy that server release before connecting this package to an older environment.

Clone the repository and install its dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/flashdata-dev/flashdata-mcp.git
cd flashdata-mcp
npm ci
export FLASHDATA_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
npm start
```

The process communicates over stdin/stdout; it does not show a web page or interactive prompt. Use `node bin/flashdata-mcp.js --help` for configuration help. Normal protocol operation writes no banners or request data to stdout or stderr.

For a local clone, configure Claude Desktop (or another stdio MCP client) with an absolute path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flashdata": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/flashdata-mcp/bin/flashdata-mcp.js"],
      "env": { "FLASHDATA_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the full path to Node if your desktop app cannot find it. On Windows, use an escaped Windows path. Keep credentials in your client's protected configuration, not in a prompt, URL, committed file, or command-line argument.

You can also install the reviewed artifact with `npm install /absolute/path/flashdata-mcp-0.1.0.tgz` in a separate project and run its `node_modules/.bin/flashdata-mcp` executable. A public `npx` command will be documented after publication.

## Tools and billing

A fully authorized key discovers 22 tools. Discovery and execution are filtered by the current key's scopes.

| Tools | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `google_search`, `google_images`, `google_news`, `google_shopping`, `google_videos`, `google_places` | Realtime or async Google data |
| `youtube_search`, `youtube_search_extended`, `youtube_metadata`, `youtube_transcript`, `youtube_captions`, `youtube_trainability`, `youtube_channel`, `youtube_suggestions` | Realtime or async YouTube data |
| `youtube_download` | Async video/audio delivery to customer storage |
| `submit_batch` | Submit multiple queries, including downloads, as background jobs |
| `get_job` | Read task status and completed JSON results |
| `get_result` | Read another segment of a large response without repeating the query |
| `get_balance`, `get_pricing`, `get_limits`, `get_usage` | Free account reads |

The software is free; queries use your existing FlashData Credits and plan limits. Downloads reserve Credits and settle by actual uploaded bytes. `get_pricing` returns current account pricing; Catalog estimates are not a billing authority. One user task may lead an agent to make multiple paid calls.

Start with “Check my FlashData balance, pricing and limits.” This does not submit a paid query. Then ask for the data you need, such as “Find three YouTube videos about home battery storage, retrieve their available transcripts, and include the source URLs.” The agent decides which tools to use.

Do not automatically repeat a timed-out query: it may already have been submitted and charged. JSON-RPC IDs are not billing idempotency keys. Check Jobs first. Read failures do not imply refunds.

Downloads require a `storage` object matching the [Download API](https://flashdata.dev/docs/sources/youtube_download). Storage credentials must come from the user's configured destination; never invent or echo them. The existing download protocol transmits these credentials to FlashData to perform the upload. This release does not inject storage credentials from a local file or hide them from the MCP client's tool arguments. Private object URLs still require the destination's own access controls.

Use dedicated, narrowly scoped, short-lived storage credentials where supported. Tool arguments may be retained in your MCP client's history or debug logs, even when the server itself does not log them. See [Security](SECURITY.md) for the trust boundaries and private vulnerability reporting channel.

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default / requirement |
| --- | --- |
| `FLASHDATA_API_KEY` | Required; user's FlashData key |
| `FLASHDATA_DATA_API_URL` | `https://data.flashdata.dev` |
| `FLASHDATA_MANAGEMENT_API_URL` | `https://api.flashdata.dev` |
| `FLASHDATA_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `65000`; integer from 1000 to 120000 |

API URLs must be HTTPS origins without credentials, path, query or fragment. Loopback HTTP is allowed for local development. Do not append `/v1` or `/v2`. Set custom origins only to servers you trust: they receive your key and queries. The package does not load `.env` automatically.

Every tool discovery or call revalidates API access through Management, including reads from the local result cache. Revoked keys and removed scopes cannot continue to access cached results. Management availability is therefore required for local tools; the existing hosted Data API/MCP keeps its own runtime boundaries. API access reads share a limit of 120 requests/minute per client IP; account tools also make their respective read request.

Completed jobs use the signed result URL returned by Management. The result origin must match the origin advertised by the authenticated `/v2/api-access` response, and use HTTPS (or loopback HTTP). API credentials are never sent to object storage, and storage redirects are not followed. This origin must be reachable from the machine running the local package.

## Large results and protocol

The local server uses stdio. The FlashData hosted endpoint continues to use Streamable HTTP. This project implements the public tool contract independently and connects to FlashData through REST APIs. This package does not implement OAuth, scraping, provider credentials, a credit ledger, or a local worker.

Responses over 16,000 UTF-16 code units are split into JSON text chunks. Use `result_id` and `next_offset`, concatenate in order, then parse JSON. The in-memory store holds at most four results, each for ten minutes; restart clears it. The limit is per local process, and results are not shared with the hosted MCP cache. Each complete JSON response is limited to 4 MiB. Async JSON results retain the API's 24-hour window; media retention follows customer storage.

## Development and packaging

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run check:package
npm run test:install
npm pack
```

Tests spawn an actual SDK stdio client against isolated local HTTP fixtures. They cover discovery, authorization changes, account reads, argument validation, query/download/batch forwarding, unknown POST outcomes, credential-free result delivery and bounded Unicode result caching. They do not contact paid providers or require Redis/MongoDB.

`npm run test:install` also installs the packed tarball into an empty temporary project and runs the stdio contract against its installed executable.

`npm pack` runs tests and verifies the file allowlist. The npm tarball contains the CLI, source, README, license and notices; it excludes tests, credentials, private backend code, deployment files and node_modules. A source repository should also retain tests, scripts, the lockfile, and the CI workflow.
